This will serve as a place for code style guides and other general information about the CUI codebase.

## Workflow

Here's a good [cheat sheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) describing a way to work on git projects.

If you do not have [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) already install it using `$ brew install git-flow`

### Initial Setup on a New Repository

 - Check your existing branches with `$ git branch -a`
 - If you do not have a `develop` branch create it using `git checkout -b develop` (this will create a new branch called develop and switch to it)

### Initial Setup on Local Machine

 - To start using git flow run `git flow init`
 - This will start git-flow on your computer. Use all of the defaults suggested.
